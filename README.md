- This repository contains the Neural Style Transfer code adapted from the tutorial available on PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html
- This repository also contains the code adapted from the U-Net PyTorch tutorial written by Chandhok: https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/11/08/u-net-training-image-segmentation-models-in-pytorch/


The dataset provided in this repository is entirely composed of synthetic images to prevent the unauthorised distribution of real sonar data.
